# Prepare Your Model

> Before publishing models, make sure you have completed the [Account Setup](/getting-started/quick-start#account-setup).

<Note>
Currently, KoalaVault only supports models in **safetensors** format. Models in other formats (e.g., GGUF) are not supported yet.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install koava CLI Tool">
    The `koava` is the command-line tool of KoalaVault, used to encrypt and publish your LLM models.

    Install the koava command-line tool with HuggingFace CLI support:

    ```bash
    pip install -U "koava[huggingface]"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authentication Setup">
    1. Login to koava with your API key ([generate KoalaVault API key](https://www.koalavault.ai/api-keys)):
    
    ```bash
    koava login
    # Enter your KoalaVault API key when prompted
    ```

    2. Login to HuggingFace CLI (`hf`) with your token ([generate HuggingFace Token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), choose `Write` access):

    ```bash
    hf auth login
    # Enter your HuggingFace token when prompted
    ```

    3. Verify the authentication status:
    ```bash
    koava status
    ```

      You should see the authentication status as below:
    
    ```bash
    # Version: 0.0.11
    # Authentication: Authenticated
    # Username: <your-username>
    # Email: <your-email>
    # Server: Connected 
    # Hugging Face CLI: Logged in as <your-username>
    ```
  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Encrypt & Push Model">
    1. Download [Qwen3-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B) to your local directory:

    ```bash
    hf download Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --local-dir ./qwen3-0.6b
    ```

    2. Encrypt and push your model to KoalaVault and HuggingFace:

    ```bash
    koava push ./qwen3-0.6b
    ```
    3. Your model is now created on KoalaVault and HuggingFace. 

        **Full encrypted model**: hosted on HuggingFace, publicly accessible for download by anyone.
        ```bash
        https://huggingface.co/<your-huggingface-username>/qwen3-0.6b
        ``` 
        **Decryption keys and metadata**: securely hosted on KoalaVault to enforce access control and ensure buyer isolation.
    
        ```bash
        https://www.koalavault.ai/<your-koalavault-username>/qwen3-0.6b
        ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Set Model Pricing & Publish

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Model Pricing">
    1. Visit [KoalaVault.ai](https://www.koalavault.ai) and navigate to **My Models**
    2. Locate your newly pushed model from the list
    3. Click on the model to open its detail page
    4. Navigate to the **Pricing** tab and click **Create Pricing Strategy**
    5. Configure your pricing options:
       - Set a per-deployment price (or set to `0 USDT` for free models)
    
    <Note>
    Your pricing strategy must be published before buyers can see it. Draft strategies are not visible to the public.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish & Share Your Model">
    Once your pricing is set, you're ready to publish! **Click the Publish button** on your model page to make it live.
    
    ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** Your model is now live on the KoalaVault marketplace! ðŸŒŸ
    
    ### Start Earning Automatically
    
    Every time someone purchases your model, **payments are automatically sent to your digital wallet** via blockchain transactions. No manual invoicing, no payment delays â€“ just instant, secure payments directly to you.
    
    **Share your model and start monetizing:**
    - Share your model page URL with your community
    - Post on social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit)
    - Include it in your research papers or blog posts
    - Add it to your GitHub README or personal website
    
    <Tip>
    The more you promote your model, the more deployments you'll get, and the more revenue you'll earn! Build your passive income stream with KoalaVault.
