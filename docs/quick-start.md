## Publish Models as a Seller

### Step 1: Install `koava` Tool

1. Install the koava command-line tool with HuggingFace CLI support:

```bash
pip install koava[huggingface]
```

### Step 2: Authentication Setup

1. Login to koava with your API key ([Generate API Key](https://www.koalavault.ai/api-keys)):
```bash
koava login
# Enter your KoalaVault API key when prompted
```

2. Login to HuggingFace CLI with your token ([Generate HuggingFace Token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), choose `Write` access)

```bash
hf auth login
# Enter your HuggingFace token when prompted
```

3. Verify authentication status:
```bash
koava status
```

### Step 3: Download Model from HuggingFace

1. Download [Qwen3-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B) to your local directory:

```bash
# Download the model using HuggingFace CLI
hf download Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --local-dir ./qwen3-0.6b
```

### Step 4: Push Model to KoalaVault with `koava`

1. Encrypt and upload your model to KoalaVault and HuggingFace:

```bash
# Push the model (this will create, encrypt, and upload)
koava push ./qwen3-0.6b
```

> Your full model is hosted on HuggingFace and can be accessed by others using `hf download` command.
> Part of the model is hosted on KoalaVault to control the access to the model, which is available to the paid users.

### Step 5: Set Pricing

1. Visit [KoalaVault.ai](https://www.koalavault.ai)
2. Find your just pushed model in **My Models**
3. In the model page, click **Pricing** then create a new pricing strategy
4. **Remember to publish the pricing strategy to make it effective**

### Step 6: Publish Model

1. After above steps, your model can be published. Click **Publish** in the model page.
2. ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** Your model is now live and ready to share with the world! ðŸŒŸ

## Deploy Models as a Buyer

> Model owner can always access to the model whether it is published or not. To deploy the model as model owner, directly go to [step 5](#step-5-pull-the-koalavault-enhanced-vllm-docker-image).

### Step 1: Create an Order

1. [Browse the marketplace](https://www.koalavault.ai/models) and find the model you want to purchase
2. In the model page, click **Purchase** in the top right corner
3. In the **Create Order** page, select the pricing plan you prefer
4. ** It is recommended to use the anonymous payment to purchase the model in the first time, which allows you to pay directly from exchanges like Binance without transferring to your registered wallet first. **
5. Click **Create Order**. In the order detail page, you can see the payment instructions and seller's address.

### Step 2: Pay for the Order

1. Copy the **Payment Address** from the order detail page
2. [Go to Binance Deposit page](https://www.binance.com/en/my/wallet/account/main/withdrawal/crypto)(Global) or [binance.us](https://www.binance.us/en/my/wallet/account/main/withdrawal/crypto)(US) and choose **Withdraw Crypto**
3. In the **Select Coin** dropdown, choose `USDT`
4. In the **Withdraw to**, paste the **Payment Address** you copied from the order detail page
5. In the **Select Network** dropdown, choose `BSC`
6. Enter the amount of your order to **Withdraw Amount**
7. Click **Withdraw**
8. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed

### Step 3: Confirm the Order

1. After you get the transaction id from Binance, you can copy the transaction id and paste it to the **Blockchain Transaction ID** field in the order detail page
2. Click **Confirm** in the order detail page. The order will be confirmed by KoalaVault and the model will be available for you to use.

### Step 4: Download the Model

As Koalavault only hosts the part of the model, you need to first download the full model from HuggingFace. 

1. Install `koava` with HuggingFace CLI support if you haven't done so:
```bash
pip install koava[huggingface]
```

2. Download the model from HuggingFace (you can see the download command in the model detail page under **Deploy** tab):
```bash
hf download <MODEL_OWNER>/<MODEL_NAME> --local-dir ./<MODEL_NAME>
```

### Step 5: Pull the KoalaVault enhanced vLLM docker image

```bash
docker pull koalavault/vllm-openai
```

### Step 6: Deploy the Model

Deploy the vLLM container with the downloaded model and replace the API key and model name with your KoalaVault username and model name:

```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm -it \
  -v ./<MODEL_NAME>:/model \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --ipc=host \
  --read-only \
  --cap-drop ALL --security-opt no-new-privileges \
  --tmpfs /dev/shm:exec,nosuid,nodev \
  --tmpfs /tmp:exec,nosuid,nodev \
  --tmpfs /root/.triton:exec,nosuid,nodev \
  --tmpfs /root/.cache:exec,nosuid,nodev \
  koalavault/vllm-openai \
  --koalavault-api-key <KOALAVAULT_API_KEY> \
  --koalavault-model <MODEL_OWNER/MODEL_NAME> \
  --model /model \
```

> **Note:** To ensure that model decryption happens in a secure environment, we enforce strict controls on how the container is launched.  
> These flags must remain unchanged in the startup command. Otherwise, the container will terminate immediately.
> 
> - `--read-only`
> - `--cap-drop ALL --security-opt no-new-privileges`
> - `--tmpfs /dev/shm:exec,nosuid,nodev`
> - `--tmpfs /tmp:exec,nosuid,nodev`
> - `--tmpfs /root/.triton:exec,nosuid,nodev`
> - `--tmpfs /root/.cache:exec,nosuid,nodev`

> **Note:** The model must be mounted to `/model` inside the container, as this is the only writable disk space available.
