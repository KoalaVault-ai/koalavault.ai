<Note>
Currently, we only support USDT (Tether) on the BSC (Binance Smart Chain) network for all transactions.
</Note>

## Why Cryptocurrency?

KoalaVault uses cryptocurrency payments for:
- ‚úÖ **Global accessibility** - Works in 140+ countries
- ‚úÖ **End-to-end transactions** - Direct payment to seller, no KoalaVault intermediary

## Supported Networks and Tokens

- **Token**: USDT (Tether - a stablecoin pegged to USD)
- **Network**: BSC (Binance Smart Chain), BEP-20 for USDT
- **Why BSC?**: Extremely low transaction fees and fast confirmation times

## How to Get a BSC Wallet Address

<Tip>
**How to understand concepts like "Wallet Address", "Network", "Token"?**

- **Wallet**: In the most basic sense, a wallet is just an asymmetric key pair (with public key and private key). The public key (or hash of the public key) is your **wallet address**, and the private key is your **password to the wallet**.
  - You can create as many wallets as you want, since you can generate as many public key/private key pairs as you want.
  - Others can send cryptocurrency to your wallet address, and you can use the private key to sign transactions to spend the cryptocurrency.
  - So you can safely share your wallet address with others, but keep the private key private.
- **Network**: Also known as "blockchain", you can think of it as a **"code repo"** (while actually it's a **"transaction repo"**) of all the transactions that have ever happened in this repo (**think of it as commit push to the repo**).
  - Each transaction is a record of a transfer of cryptocurrency from one wallet address to another. More like **"I, John, tell the world, that Tom has XX additional USDT in his wallet, which he got from me"**. Since only John has the private key to sign this transaction, others can verify it, but not change it.
  - There are many different networks (**"transaction repos"**), each with their own unique features and rules.
  - For each network (**"transaction repo"**), it is not controlled by a single entity, but somehow managed by the whole community of users. (The biggest difference between a real blockchain and a **"repo"**).

- **Token**: The token is the cryptocurrency itself. Think of it as the **"code"** in the **"transaction repo"**.
  - Each network (**"transaction repo"**) can have multiple tokens (**"code in C, C++, Python, etc."**), each with their own unique features and rules.
  - Each token (**"code"**) can be hosted on different networks (**"transaction repos"**), but the token accros different networks (**"transaction repos"**) cannot be transferred directly (**"different context in different repos"**).
