  </Step>
</Steps>

# Troubleshooting

### Payment Not Confirmed

**Issue**: Payment sent but order still shows as unpaid.

**Solutions**:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for blockchain confirmation
2. Verify you sent to the correct address
3. Check you used BSC network (not other networks)
4. Ensure you sent the exact amount
5. Contact support if issue persists

### Wrong Network Used

**Issue**: Sent USDT on wrong network (e.g., Ethereum instead of BSC).

**Solution**: Unfortunately, funds sent to wrong network cannot be recovered. Always double-check the network before sending.

### Insufficient Amount

**Issue**: Sent less than the order amount.

**Solution**: Send an additional transaction for the remaining amount, then submit both transaction IDs to support.

### Transaction Stuck

**Issue**: Transaction pending for a long time.

**Solutions**:
1. Check blockchain explorer (BscScan) for transaction status
2. If pending, wait for network confirmation (can take up to 30 minutes during high congestion)
3. If failed, try sending again
4. Contact your exchange support if funds were deducted but transaction failed

# Payment Security

### Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Always verify the payment address before sending
- ‚úÖ Send a small test transaction first for large amounts
- ‚úÖ Use two-factor authentication (2FA) on your exchange
- ‚úÖ Keep transaction IDs for your records
- ‚úÖ Only use official KoalaVault website

### What KoalaVault Does NOT Do

- ‚ùå Never asks for your private keys
- ‚ùå Never asks for your exchange passwords
- ‚ùå Never initiates withdrawals from your wallet
- ‚ùå Never requests payment to personal accounts

<Warning>
**Beware of Scams**: Only use payment addresses shown on the official KoalaVault website. Never send funds to addresses received via email, social media, or messaging apps.
</Warning>
