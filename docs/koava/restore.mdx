# Usage

```bash
koava restore <MODEL_PATH> [OPTIONS]
```

For help:
```bash
koava restore -h
```

# Description

The `restore` command undoes encryption by restoring original files from the automatic backup created by `koava encrypt`. 

<Note>
The `restore` command is only needed for in-place encryption (when `--output` was not specified). When encrypting to a different directory with `--output`, your original files remain unchanged in the source directory, so no restoration is needed.
</Note>

## How Restore Works

The backup and restore operations only involve safetensors files. When you restore:

1. All encrypted safetensors files in the model directory are removed
2. Original safetensors files are copied back from the `.backup` directory
3. The model directory is restored to its initial unencrypted state


# Examples

```bash
koava restore ./my-model
```

# Advanced

## Arguments

### MODEL_PATH
