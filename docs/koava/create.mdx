# Usage

```bash
koava create <MODEL_NAME> [OPTIONS]

```bash
koava create -h
```

# Description

The `create` command registers a new model on the KoalaVault. This is the first step in the manual workflow (advanced users).

For most users, the [`koava push`](/koava/push) command is recommended as it combines create, encrypt, and upload in one step.

# Examples

```bash
# Basic model creation
koava create my-model

# Create with description
koava create my-model --description "Fine-tuned GPT-2 model for text generation"
```

# Advanced

## Arguments

### MODEL_NAME
Name for your model on KoalaVault (required, alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, no spaces).

## Options

### --description, -d
Optional description for your model to explain what it does, training details, etc.

```bash
koava create my-model --description "My model description"
```
