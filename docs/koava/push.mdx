# Usage

```bash
koava push <MODEL_PATH> [OPTIONS]
```

For help:
```bash
koava push -h
```

# Description

The `push` command is the recommended way to publish models to KoalaVault. It combines four steps into one:

1. **Create**: Create the model on KoalaVault
2. **Encrypt**: Convert safetensors files to encrypted format
3. **Upload**: Upload metadata to KoalaVault
4. **Publish**: Create model on Hugging Face and upload complete encrypted files, then update KoalaVault with Hugging Face URL and README

This is the easiest way for most users to publish their models.

<Note>
Currently, KoalaVault only supports `safetensors` format files. Convert your model to safetensors format first if needed.
</Note>

# Examples

```bash
# Basic push
koava push ./my-model

# Push with custom name and description
koava push ./my-model --name "my-encrypted-model" --description "Fine-tuned GPT-2 model for text generation"

# Force push (overwrite existing)
koava push ./my-model --force
```

# Advanced

```

### --description, -d
Model description for marketplace listing on KoalaVault.
