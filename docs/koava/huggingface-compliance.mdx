## Understanding Hugging Face’s Requirements

Hugging Face maintains a clear set of expectations for all hosted models, summarized as:

1. **Clarity and Transparency** — Repositories must clearly describe what users are downloading and how it can be used.  
2. **Proper Licensing** — A valid license must accompany each repository, defining rights and restrictions.  
3. **Accurate Representation** — Non-open models must not be presented as open-source.  
4. **Respect for Legal Boundaries** — Licensing and redistribution must comply with applicable copyright law.

For official guidance, see Hugging Face policies: [Code of Conduct](https://huggingface.co/code-of-conduct), and [Terms of Service](https://huggingface.co/terms-of-service). If a link is temporarily unavailable, refer to the Hub docs index at [Hub Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index).

**KoalaVault’s encryption and authorization system is designed with these principles in mind**.  
Our goal is not to obscure, but to help model developers distribute protected artifacts **transparently and responsibly**.


## How KoalaVault Stays Compliant

### 1. Default Private Repositories

**What happens**  
When you push a model using `koava push`, KoalaVault creates the Hugging Face repository as **private by default**.

**Why this matters**  
Private creation ensures that your repository is reviewed for clarity, license accuracy, and compliance **before** it becomes visible to the public.  
This default behavior follows Hugging Face’s own guidance, which recommends keeping repositories private until they are ready for release.

**How to make it public**  
You can make your repository public at any time via:  
- **Settings → Repository visibility → Make public**  
- or by using the `--public` flag when running `koava push`, see [koava push](/koava/push) for more details.



### 2. Automatic README Compliance Block

**What happens**  
During encryption (`koava encrypt`), KoalaVault inserts a short compliance block in your `README.md`.

**Purpose**  
This block clarifies that:
- the model is **encrypted and not open source**;  
- KoalaVault handles **authorization and subscription validation**;  
- users need valid authorization before decryption or execution.  

The block includes an invisible marker, ensuring we never insert duplicates and preserving your original README content.



### 3. Dual License Structure

**What happens**  
KoalaVault never replaces your original license. Instead, it adds a parallel license file named `LICENSE.KOALAVAULT`.

**Why this is important**  
- The **original license** (e.g., MIT, Apache, custom commercial) continues to define ownership and legal rights.  
- The **KoalaVault license** defines redistribution and execution rules for **encrypted artifacts only**.

**In effect:**  
- ✅ Redistribution of unmodified encrypted files is allowed.  
- ✅ Execution requires verified authorization via KoalaVault.  
- ❌ Decryption, modification, or derivative work without authorization is prohibited.  
- ❌ Circumvention or reverse-engineering of encryption or policy controls is prohibited.

This structure ensures legal clarity while fully respecting the original author’s rights.


## Compliance Checklist

Before publishing a model publicly, ensure:

- [x] Repository was created as **private** by default.  
- [x] `README.md` contains the short compliance block.  
- [x] `LICENSE.KOALAVAULT` is present alongside your original license.  
- [x] The original license file is preserved and unmodified.  


## Manual Publishing Flow

After running `koava push`:

1. Visit your model page at `https://huggingface.co/<username>/<model-name>`.  
2. Review `README.md` and both license files.  
3. Confirm clarity and compliance.  
4. In Settings, change **Repository visibility** to **Public** when ready.  
5. Optionally, share your Hugging Face link in your KoalaVault listing.
