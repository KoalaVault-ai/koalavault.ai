# Usage

```bash
koava status
```

For help:
```bash
koava status -h
```

# Description

Shows your KoalaVault authentication status, user info, and server connection status.

It also shows the Hugging Face CLI status, which is important because the `push` command requires Hugging Face CLI to be logged in, as it automatically creates public models on Hugging Face and uploads encrypted models there.

<Note>
The `status` command automatically detects Hugging Face CLI status by calling `hf auth whoami`.
</Note>

# Examples

## Check Status

```bash
koava status
```

Normal output (everything working):
```
