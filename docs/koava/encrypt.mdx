# Usage

```bash
koava encrypt <MODEL_PATH> [OPTIONS]
```

Aliases:
```bash
koava enc <MODEL_PATH> [OPTIONS]
```

For help:
```bash
koava encrypt -h
```

# Description

The `encrypt` command:
- converts standard `safetensors` files to `cryptotensors` format (i.e, KoalaVault's encrypted format). See [CryptoTensors File Format](/security/cryptotensors) for detailed information about the encrypted format.
- inserts compliance block into `README.md` and adds `LICENSE.KOALAVAULT` to clearly state the model is encrypted and license-gated via KoalaVault. See [Hugging Face Compliance](/koava/huggingface-compliance) for more details.

<Note>
**Important**: After encryption, you must create a model on Hugging Face, upload the complete encrypted model files, and then update the KoalaVault model page with the Hugging Face URL. You can use the [`koava push`](/koava/push) command to do this complete workflow in one step.
</Note>

<Note>
Currently, KoalaVault only supports `safetensors` format files.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before running `encrypt`, you must ensure that a model has been created on KoalaVault (either manually or using [`koava create`](/koava/create)). This is required because KoalaVault generates model-specific encryption and user-specific signing keys for each publisher and model only after a model is created. The `encrypt` command needs to retrieve these keys to encrypt and sign your model files.

## Backup Process

When encrypting in-place (without specifying `--output`), the `encrypt` command automatically creates a backup of your original files before encryption. The backup is stored in a `.backup` directory within your model folder, ensuring your original files are preserved in case you need to restore them later. 

## README & License Handling

This section explains how `encrypt` updates documentation to ensure compliance while preserving your originals.

- README
  - Duplicate-safe insertion: the tool uses an invisible marker to ensure the compliance block is inserted at most once.
  - In-place (default): inserts a short compliance block into `<MODEL_PATH>/README.md` (after the first title). If no README exists, a minimal README is created.
  - With `--output`: the source README is never modified. A `README.md` is written to the output directory: if a source README exists, the block is inserted into that content; otherwise, a minimal README is created in the output.
  - Restore behavior: if no README backup is present but the current README contains the marker, `koava restore` removes the tool-inserted README (in in-place scenarios).

- License
  - The original `LICENSE` is never modified.
  - A parallel `LICENSE.KOALAVAULT` is created alongside the encrypted model files to clarify redistribution and execution rights for encrypted artifacts.
  - `koava restore` removes `LICENSE.KOALAVAULT`.

# Examples

## Basic Encryption Workflow

```bash
# 1. Preview what will be encrypted
koava encrypt ./my-model --dry-run

# 2. Encrypt the model
koava encrypt ./my-model -n "my-awesome-model"

# 3. Verify encryption was successful
ls ./my-model/
```

## Custom Output Workflow

```bash
# 1. Encrypt to separate directory
koava encrypt ./my-model --output ./encrypted-models --name "my-llm"

# 2. Verify output
ls ./encrypted-models/
```

# Advanced

## Arguments

### MODEL_PATH
Directory containing safetensors files to encrypt (required).

## Options

### --name, -n
Model name for encryption key retrieval, must match the model name on KoalaVault.

Default resolution order when not provided:
- If `--output/-o` is specified: use the basename of the output directory
- Otherwise: use the basename of `<MODEL_PATH>`

```bash
# Explicitly set name
koava encrypt ./my-model --name "llama-7b-chat"

# Defaults to output directory basename (my-aws-model)
koava encrypt ./qwen3-0.6b --output ./my-aws-model

# Defaults to model path basename (my-model)
koava encrypt ./my-model
```

### --output, -o
Output directory for encrypted files (defaults to in-place encryption).

When specified, the encrypted model will be saved in the specified directory.

```bash
koava encrypt ./my-model --output ./encrypted-models
```

### --no-backup
Skip automatic backup (only works when `--output` is not specified, i.e. when encrypting in-place).

When not specified, a backup directory `.backup` will be created in the same directory as the model. 
The original model files will be copied to the backup directory before encryption.

```bash
koava encrypt ./my-model --no-backup
```

<Note>
**Warning**: Skipping backup is not recommended. If encryption fails, you may lose your original files.
</Note>

### --files
Only encrypt specific model files (comma-separated, only includes model files, not configuration files).

When not specified, all model files will be encrypted.

```bash
koava encrypt ./my-model --files "model1.safetensors,model2.safetensors"
```

### --exclude
Exclude specific model files from encryption (comma-separated, only includes model files, not configuration files).

When not specified, all model files will be encrypted.

```bash
koava encrypt ./my-model --exclude "model1.safetensors,model2.safetensors"
```

### --dry-run
Preview what would be encrypted without making changes.

```bash
koava encrypt ./my-model --dry-run
```

### --force
Force encryption even if backup directory exists.

When a backup directory already exists with unencrypted files:
- Without `--force`: Encrypts from the existing backup files
- With `--force`: Overwrites the backup directory with current files, then encrypts

This flag only affects in-place encryption when a backup directory already exists.

```bash
koava encrypt ./my-model --force
```

# Restore Original Files

To restore original files:
```bash
koava restore ./my-model
```

See [koava restore](/koava/restore) for details.
