description: "Upload encrypted model file metadata to KoalaVault"

# Usage

```bash
koava upload <MODEL_PATH> [OPTIONS]
```

For help:
```bash
koava upload -h
```

# Description

The `upload` command uploads the metadata (i.e., the header) of your encrypted model files to KoalaVault's servers. 

<Note>
**Important**: After uploading metadata to KoalaVault, you must also create a model on Hugging Face, upload the complete encrypted model files, and then update the KoalaVault model page with the Hugging Face URL. You can use the [`koava push`](/koava/push) command to do this complete workflow in one step.
</Note>

This is the final step in the manual workflow. For most users, the [`koava push`](/koava/push) command is recommended as it handles create, encrypt, and upload in one step.

# Examples

```bash
# Basic upload
koava upload ./my-model

# Upload with custom name
koava upload ./my-model --name "my-encrypted-model"

# Force upload (overwrite existing)
koava upload ./my-model --force
```

# Advanced

## Arguments

### MODEL_PATH
Directory containing encrypted model files (required).

## Options

### --name, -n
Model name on KoalaVault (must match the model name on KoalaVault, defaults to directory name).

<Note>
The model name must also match the model name specified when [encrypting](/koava/encrypt) the model files.

KoalaVault will failed when veriying the encryption and signing keys, leading to rejection of the upload.
</Note>

```bash
koava upload ./my-model --name "my-encrypted-model"
```

### --force, -f

When the model files have already been uploaded to KoalaVault, this option allows you to overwrite the existing files without errors.


```bash
koava upload ./my-model --force
```
